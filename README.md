# Vanilla JavaScript Projects

I Created my beautiful Projects Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to level up my skills.
You can see all projects live here. The projects cover a range of topics and techniques, including fundamental concepts such as variables, loops, and functions, as well as more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming and asynchronous programming. Each project is designed to challenge and engage you, helping you to develop a deeper understanding of JavaScript and its applications. By working through these projects, you will have the opportunity to apply what you have learned and see the results firsthand, giving you a sense of accomplishment and motivation to continue learning and growing as a developer.
